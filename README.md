# pyBCN Talk - cffi: C Foreign Function Interface for Python

cffi is a C Foreign Function Interface for Python. It allows to interact with
almost any C code from Python, based on C-like declarations that you can often
copy-paste from header files or documentation. In this presentation it is
compared with native extensions and ctypes with simple examples. Finally, a real
production example is shown.
